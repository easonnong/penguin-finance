# Security considerations

### Rebase/fee-on-transfer tokens

Rebase and fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported by the AMM.
Using these tokens will break the swap curve and liquidity maths.

### Stuck tokens/nfts

There exists no recovery mechanism for tokens that are accidentally transferred to the AMM.
If tokens or NFTs are accidentally sent to the contract, then they cannot be withdrawn.

### Malicious base token or NFT contracts

It's assumed that all NFTs and base token contracts used to create new pairs are honest.
The user must use their own discretion when deciding whether or not to interact with a particular pair contract and check that the NFT and base token contracts are honest.
